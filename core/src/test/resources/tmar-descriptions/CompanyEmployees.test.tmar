Company employees

Use those master data :
/include  MasterData

Here is some test case to check that employees are correctly added and removed from company :

Let's check few things :
 /sequence
 [ operation | table name | count ? | 
 | COUNT     | Employee   | 5       | 
 | COUNT     | City       | 3       | 
 | COUNT     | Team       | 3       | 
 | COUNT     | Company    | 1       | 
 | COUNT     | Department | 2       | 
NB : events are also created when employees are created, then we should have the same result :
 | COUNT     | Event      | 5       | 

Now let's that some objects are found :
 /sequence
 [ operation | table    | key        | exists ? | 
 | EXISTS    | City     | CI1        | true     | 
 | EXISTS    |          |            |          | 
 | EXISTS    | Team     | TE0        | true     | 
 | EXISTS    | Employee | 2256725396 | true     |
